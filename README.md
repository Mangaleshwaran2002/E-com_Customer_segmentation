# E-commerce Customer Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

In this project, we explore customer behavior patterns within an e-commerce dataset. By applying K-Means Clustering, we group customers based on their purchasing habits, preferences, and interactions with the platform. The resulting segments provide valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, personalized recommendations, and inventory management.

Key Features:
==============

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed raw transaction data.
- Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features (e.g., purchase frequency, total spending).
- K-Means Clustering: Identified distinct customer segments.
- Visualization: Visualized segment characteristics using countplot,heatmap,KElbowVisualizer and bar charts.

## Save the cluster in new csv file
- save the cluster info in Cluster_data.csv
